# Who's Ashley and What's She Creating? 👩🏿‍💻

Hey y'all 👋🏿, I just wanted to start off by saying THANK YOU for coming along this journey with me as I document my journey to become an AI Engineer with a focus in Cloud Security. If I didn't mention before, my name is Ashley (Ash) and I am from the "oh so sweet and peachy" state of Georgia 🍑. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, Master of Science in Cybersecurity & I share an undeniable passion for Cybersecurity, AI/ML, Healthcare and Education. 

I will be using this platform to show case projects I am currently building and/or contributing to in various languages, case studies I have spent time reviewing/analyzing for data purposes, and anything else I feel will better showcase who I am and what I represent. Welcome again and I hope you all enjoy this journey alongside me.

***Things I'm currently learning***:
- Spanish & Twi (to become a fluent speaker, reader & writer)
- Horseback Riding (living out my childhood dreams of becoming an Equestrian) 
- The Law (I feel like everyone should take the time to learn the law and who/what/where/when/why/how of its governance in our daily lives)

***Top 5 Travel Destinations ✈️***:
- Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast); A lot of my family is from here so seeing them and experiencing the culture is top on my list
- Japan; They're literally so ahead in technology I have to go and see it for myself 
- Seychelles; This country isn't spoken about a lot and that's the beauty in it
- Papua New Guinea; I've been interested in this place since I was 10, so it's just a must
- Greece; The architecture and scenery are just breathtaking, I'd love to experience this in real life

***Hobbies 🏋🏿‍♀️***:
* Exercising, Cooking, Traveling, Blogging, Reading, Journaling & I absolutely adore spending time with my loved ones.

### Let's *GIT* this show on the road 🚀
