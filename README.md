# Who's Ashley and What's She Creating? 👩🏿‍💻

Hey y'all 👋🏿, I just wanted to start off by saying THANK YOU for coming along this journey with me as I document my journey to becoming a DevSecOps Engineer who was originally Software Engineer. If I didn't mention before, my name is Ashley and I am from the "oh so sweet and peachy" state of Georgia 🍑 but currently reside in the Lone Star State of Texas 🤠. I hold a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science and currently completing my Masters of Science in Cybersecurity. I share an undeniable passion for Cybersecurity (GRC & Data Privacy), Aritficial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Cryptography (Encryption), FinTech and Women's Health (especially those in under represented groups). 

I will be using this platform to show case projects I am currently building and/or contributing to in various languages (Python mostly; with occasionaly contributions from Java & React.js), case studies I have spent time reviewing/analyzing for data purposes, and anything else I feel will better showcase who I am and what I represent. Welcome again and I hope you all enjoy this journey alongside me.
