# Who's Ashley and What's She Creating? 👩🏿‍💻

Hi y'all 👋🏿, I just wanted to start off by saying THANK YOU for coming along this journey with me as I document my journey to becoming a Cloud Security Engineer. If I didn't mention before, my name is Ashley and I am from the "oh so sweet and peachy" state of Georgia 🍑. I recently graduated with my Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science and will be pursuing my Masters of Science in Cybersecurity starting January 2023. I share an undeniable passion for Cybersecurity, Data Science and Women's Health (especially those in under represented groups). I will be using this platform to show case projects I am currently building and/or contributing to in various languages (Python, JavaScript and HTML/CSS mostly; with occasionaly contributions from Java & C++), case studies I have spent time reviewing/analyzing for data purposes, and, anything else I feel will better showcase who I am and what I represent. Welcome again and I hope you all enjoy this journey alongside me.
