# Who's Ashley and What's She Creating? 👩🏿‍💻

Hey y'all 👋🏿, I just wanted to start off by saying THANK YOU for coming along this journey with me as I document my journey to being a Full Stack Software Engineer transitioning to a Cryptography Engineer. If I didn't mention before, my name is Ashley and I am from the "oh so sweet and peachy" state of Georgia 🍑. I graduated with my Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science and currently set to have my Masters of Science in Cybersecurity in Fall 2023. I share an undeniable passion for Cybersecurity, Aritficial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Cryptography(Encryption), FinTech and Women's Health (especially those in under represented groups). 

I will be using this platform to show case projects I am currently building and/or contributing to in various languages (Java, JavaScript and Python mostly; with occasionaly contributions from HTML/CSS), case studies I have spent time reviewing/analyzing for data purposes, and anything else I feel will better showcase who I am and what I represent. Welcome again and I hope you all enjoy this journey alongside me.

***Tools 🔗***: Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML & CSS, SQL

***Things I'm currently learning📚***:
- Spanish (to become a fluent speaker & writer)
- Investing & Real Estate
- Web3, Blockchain, & DevOps + SecOps

***Top 5 Travel Destinations ✈️***:
- Israel; I've always dreamed about getting baptized in the Jordan River
- Japan; They're literally so ahead in technology I have to go and see it for myself 
- Seychelles; This country isn't spoken about a lot and that's the beauty in it, imo (in my opinion).
- Papua New Guinea; I've been interested in this place since I was 10, so it's just a must
- New Zealand; I hear everything is better down under and that it's really peaceful there
